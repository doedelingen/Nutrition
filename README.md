Analyzing nutritional needs, especially in the context of meal replacement shakes

Bottom line: I want to eat well, be healthy, be happy

I recently saw a reddit comment say "biohacking is basically what happens when a bunch of men hear about vitamins and dieting but say 'that's too girly for me, lets call it biohacking instead.' Huel and slimfast are basically the same thing."
I have a passion for frugality, so I was curious: if that's true, then why was I considering Huel? Wouldn't slimfast, or the costco brand shakes, or any other option, be cheaper?

In order to properly compare their attributes, I need to understand their attributes, so I'm going to start with the concept of Macros. This is borrowed from the fitness community, macros stands for "macronutrients" aka carbs, protien, etc.
I'm going to include quotes from reddit here, and then build a spreadsheet in google sheets to compare the macros and price of several meal recplacement options.
