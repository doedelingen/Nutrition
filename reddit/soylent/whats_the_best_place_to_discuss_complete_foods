What's the best place to discuss complete foods?
I know this sub, at least historically, is meant to discuss any and all lents. But I feel like 90% of the posts are about Soylent, often not even specifying the brand because people just assume this is the Soylent sub, and not the soylent sub. Can't blame them, since that's exactly what the sub sounds like and looks like with the Soylent brand logo in the header (...only on old.reddit.com, it turns out).

I'd love to frequent a sub with more general discussion. I found a few complete food subs, but all never gained traction and were basically dead.

Thoughts, tips?

A lot of the things discussed are already talked to death 10 years ago.

Masa vs oat flour. Type of proteins and fat source. Water vs milk base.

We still post recipes in here time to time.

This is basically the Kleenex of complete foods subs, i.e. the brand name. As far as activity goes, it's showing 40k members, but only 9 active this morning. Not that whole foods aren't as popular usage-wise, but more that the discussion has kind of run its course. We know about what our bodies need via macros:

We know about how to manage high & low blood sugar:

The Complete Foods database has over 70,000 recipes just for America alone. People still post updates on a regular basis:

There are over 8,500 ingredients in the recipe database:

We have lots of great powder & RTD vendors:

Soylent

Sated

Huel

Jimmy Joy

etc.

We have lots of great solid-food options as "enhanced" meals as well:

Vite-ramen

Keto Brick

Meal Squares

Huel Hoy & Savory pouches (chili, pasta, etc.)

Keto Chow soup bases (beef, chicken. tomato, etc.)

Soylent & Plenny bars

Plenny Pot meals (mac & chesse, veggie rice, riosotto, etc.)

etc.

So the workflow basically boils down to:

How much do you want to integrate complete foods into your diet?

Do you want off-the-shelf stuff, or do you want to try a DIY approach?

What do you like on the market or DIY-wise? (flavor, texture, etc.)

Also:

Do you like to try new things? (products, flavors, DIY mixes, using it for baking, ice creams, etc.)

Do you want to manage your macros for bodyweight control & high energy?

Do you need to manage your high or low blood sugar levels? (tailor the eating frequency, carbohydrate levels, balance meal designs with protein/carbs/fats/fiber)

I always keep some shelf-stable RTD with me for emergency foods for when I'm busy, sick, tired of cooking, stuck at work or school without good options, traveling, and in my emergency "go bag" (I grew up in Florida with hurricanes & got used to maintaining a 72-hour kit, haha!).

I also keep some powder on-hand as easy food storage. The local supermarket shelves were BARE for like two straight weeks when the lockdown first started - I'm not going through that again unprepared lol. As far as usage goes, I met one guy on here who was on liquid meals for 2 years straight, pretty crazy!

So the sub isn't crazy active as much anymore because the knowledge kind of already exists in a fleshed-out manner: flavors, macro & micro-nutrients, liquids & solids, brands, products, recipes, macros & sugar content, etc. It's more of a "how do you want to tackle it personally" as far as your eating schedule & desire to try new things goes!

There were a few subs but they all converged here shortly after I found these products
