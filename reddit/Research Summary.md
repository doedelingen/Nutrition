# Research from Reddit

Ok starting on reddit (found when researching complete foods)

User kaidomac claims most of the things related to nutrition are "solved problems." See the links from post 1 section below, but we get to the concept of macros very quickly (first link in posts 1 and 2).

Following their first link to their "macros" post (in the links from post 2, aka first post 2 link is self referential, and matches the first link from post 1).
To quote them:

Diets and bodyweight changes work off of two things:
1. CICO (calories in, calories out)
2. IIFYM (if it fits your macros)

They also claim that "we now have a formula to figure out how many grams of each macro-nutrient your body requires to gain or lose weight, based on things like your age, height, gender, and activity level" which I think is the IIFYM website/calculator they link to at some point?

## "Fat doesn't make you fat, and sugar (carbs) don't make you fat"
Simply eating too many calories for what your body uses is what makes you fat. So how do you take that knowledge & apply it in your own life, to your own situation, where you want to grow muscle (or lose/maintain weight)? It's pretty simple:

1. Figure out how much muscle weight you want to gain
2. Calculate your macros
3. Setup a meal-prep system to support those numbers

You want to maintain an overall balance according to these macros. I think the idea is if you eat a ton of ice cream (fat, carbs/sugar, calories) then you have to balance it to maintain the ratios, and keep your overall calorie intake at your planned daily intake for your activity level.

## The three macronutrients are as follows:
- Protein
- Carbs
- Fat

And each of these provide energy to your body, AKA:
- Calories
