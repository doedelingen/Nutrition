## _Desolate
I’ve been working out consistently for a few months now, switching between gymming and calisthenics but I do not seem to be growing much muscles at all. I have good form for most of my exercises too. I do consume about 80-100g protein on days where I workout and I am gaining strength but not much muscle. Help?

Update: Also, if you're struggling with sugar issues (especially metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, and Type II diabetes), just adjust your macros for >20g of carbs per day.

Update 2: Scroll down for some meal-prepping ideas to make things easier, and if you don't know how to cook, start here.

Original post:

Switch to macros.

If you are really serious about gaining muscle, then you need to level-up your diet game. That's not as scary as it sounds, once you understand how it works. For starters, all diets & bodyweight changes work off two things: (I'll explain the acronyms in a minute)

CICO

IIFYM

Your body requires fuel to operate. The high-level name of this fuel is called Calories. If you eat fewer calories than you use ("burn") during a day, then you will lose weight; if you eat more, then you will gain weight. There's no magic involved - you can't grow if you're not putting enough fuel in the gas tank every day. However, if you actually want to get in shape & grow muscle, then you need to drop down to the level below Calories. Calories is actually a math formula:

Protein + Carbs + Fats = Calories

Your body takes in two primary types of nutrients: macro-nutrients ("macros") and micro-nutrients ("micros"). The three big macros are protein, carbs, and fat, and you'll need all of them to grow (unless you have insulin issues, in which case you need to manage your carbs at a lower level). Micro-nutrients include things like vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which you typically get as a byproduct of eating your macros.

People have done a LOT of research on what is required to gain & lose weight in the human body. In simple terms, we now have a formula to figure out how many grams of each macro-nutrient your body requires to gain or lose weight, based on things like your age, height, gender, and activity level. So you can eat every day against your macros & get amazing results! Now technically, you can lose or gain weight merely by controlling your calories. You have three options for controlling your weight: (weight = fat and/or muscle)

Lose weight

Maintain weight

Gain weight

You can only lose, maintain, or gain weight - that's it, no more choices! So earlier I mentioned "CICO", which stands for "Calories in, calories out". So again, you can technically lose weight or maintain weight or gain weight simply by controlling your calories. Let's say you need 2,400 calories to maintain your weight...if all you eat is ice cream all day, but you only eat 2,200 calories, then you are now in a 200-calorie daily deficit, which means that you WILL lose weight (barring any specific health issue like Cushing's syndrome or something).

However, because you're not feeding your body correctly, you're not going to get the aesthetic & energy goals you want to achieve, because you're not feeding your body the proper macros. Remember that the three macros add up to equal calories. People who are anorexic are eating fewer calories than they burn, but (1) they are eating far too little for their daily needs, and (2) are not eating according to their macro-nutrient needs. Likewise, people who are obese are eating too many calories for what they burn, but are (1) eating far too much for their daily needs, and (2) are not eating according to their macros.

So what's the solution? Well, when you were born, you got a GI tract that consists of a stomach, a small intestine, and a big intestine. Just to over-simplify, your stomach uses acid to melt down the food into a puree, then your small intestine funnels all of the energy (macro-nutrients & micro-nutrients) to where they need to go, then your large intestine takes anything unused & pushes it out as waste (poop). As a result...your body doesn't know a Twinkie from a steak; it simply takes the food, blends it up, and funnels it to where it needs to go. From a purely CICO (calorie-counting) standpoint, again, if you eat less than you use (i.e. "eat at a deficit in order to burn the weight off"), you WILL lose weight (barring any major personal health issues). Case in point:

https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/index.html

But again...is that healthy? Are you going to look great & feel great eating nothing but calories, where you are free to feed your body say 90% carbs (sugar?) Obviously not! So what happens when you do pick a target bodyweight to achieve through losing/maintaining/gaining weight using macros? Then, over time, as you stick with it, you will get great results! Case in point:

https://nicolecapurso.com/2014/08/31/how-donuts-gave-me-abs-an-80kg-snatch/

So the next question becomes: does the food itself matter? For results, technically no, it doesn't. A guy on Youtube did an experiment where he ate a pint of ice cream every day for 30 days, but also made sure to eat against his macros, and yup - got results! Here's one of his videos:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebx7nfa7K1U

Now, does that give you a free pass to eat junk food all day? No, obviously your body likes real, whole foods - but it does remove the guilt from eating "cheat meals" and having "cheat days", because you're free to eat whatever you want, provided it fits your macros. So that's where that second acronym above comes in - "IIFYM" - which stands for you can eat whatever you want, "If it fits your macros". Again, the more real food you eat, the better, but you can also eat against your macros using fast-food, prepared foods, etc. and get results just fine. I eat at Burger King all the time (love me some Whoppers) & simply fit it into my daily macro requirements.

So the takeaway is that the professor above ate stuff like Twinkies, the fitness lady above ate donuts, and the youtube guy ate ice cream - and all got in better shape as a result - not because of the food itself, but because of the numbers (grams of protein, fats, and carbs) within the food itself. So we know fat doesn't make you fat, and sugar (carbs) don't make you fat - simply eating too many calories for what your body uses is what makes you fat. So how do you take that knowledge & apply it in your own life, to your own situation, where you want to grow muscle? It's pretty simple:

Figure out how much muscle weight you want to gain

Calculate your macros

Setup a meal-prep system to support those numbers

This is a good bodyweight calculator to start out with:

https://www.mdcalc.com/ideal-body-weight-adjusted-body-weight

Everyone's situation is different - you may need to lose some weight & then gain some muscle, or you may already be skinny & want to pack on some muscle. So the next step is to calculate your macros. You can do it as simple as adding or gaining calories & then figuring out your macro split, or you can use a calculator to figure it out for you. I like this calculator: (note that it requires email, so I'd suggest setting up a junk mail email account)

https://www.iifym.com

The subreddit here is not very active, but we have almost 130k people on the Facebook group, which I'd suggest joining for reading & support: (and check out of some of the before & after pictures for proof that it works!)

https://www.facebook.com/groups/iifym/

So you choose your weight-control path (lose, maintain, or gain weight) & then get your macros. That calculator will give you four things:

Calories

Protein

Carbs

Fat

Your job is then to focus on eating against the three macros, i.e. making sure you're hitting your protein, carbs, and fat numbers every day. The stricter you are at hitting your numbers, the faster & better your results will be. So the next question becomes, how do you hit those numbers every day? My suggestion would be to do meal-prep, which is where you cook your food ahead of time so that you can plan out your food vs. your macro numbers for each meal, and then just have to eat what you made in order to meet your macros successfully every day.

You can also do it from eating out - places like Burger King & foods like Snickers candy bars have all of the macros printed on them, which is super convenient! The downside is that eating out & buying packaged foods gets super-expensive, so unless you have the budget to support that, you can easily burn through hundreds if not thousands of dollars extra per month eating out. Like, with the guy above who ate ice cream every day for a month as part of his IIFYM experiment - a pint of Ben & Jerries ice cream costs $5.99 each where I live, so eating a pint for 31 days = $185.69 just in ice cream!

So the TL;DR is:

Calculator your macros for weight (muscle) gain

Setup a meal-prep system to eat against your macro numbers (protein, carbs, fats) every day & stick with it over time to get stellar results!

It's not rocket science, but it does require calculating your macro numbers for your weight-control goal (in your case, muscle growth through weight gain) & then setting yourself up a little system to ensure that the food you eat each day supports those numbers. And all of that is based on the premise that you want to get serious about muscle growth. So to recap:

All diets are based off CICO, but calories aren't the whole story for actual fitness results

IIFYM actually works & gives you the best results of anything out there, because it's simply a reflect of how your body & your digestive system actually works

You need to setup some sort of meal-prep system to ensure that you can accurately hit your macros each day, so that you can stick with it consistently over time in order to get results

For me, there are several benefits to eating according to your macros:

I get the best results from IIFYM (I've previously done keto, vegan, paleo, you name it)

There's no guesswork - I know exactly how many grams of protein, carbs, and fats I need to put into my body each day

I get to eat the foods I love because I can eat anything I want, if it fits my macros

It forces me to provide myself with food for every meal, ever day, because I want to hit my numbers, so I eat better & more often instead of just running out the door without breakfast or working through lunch or whatever

I save a ton of money because I eat more food made at home now

One last note, on meal timing - it doesn't matter. Eat one meal a day, eat 9 meals a day (my brother's personal trainer legit does 9 lol), as long as you're hitting your macros every day, it doesn't matter (again, unless you have a specific medical condition, like diabetes or something, where you don't want to spike your insulin from a huge meal).

The bottom line is that if you eat against your macros, you will get results (again, barring any major personal health barriers). That's simply how physics works - more fuel = more growth, less fuel = weight loss. As long as you're not eating your macros, you are going to get sub-par & slower results, and you are putting yourself at a disadvantage.

Switching to IIFYM really upped my calisthenics bodyweight workout game, because prior to that, I was unwittingly limiting myself through my dietary choices. But once you understand macros & how simple they are (calculate your numbers in 60 seconds online & then eat against them every day), then it becomes a piece of cake!

Again, this depends on how serious you are about muscle growth. If you want the best path forward, this is it! It does require some work to setup your macros vs. what you eat every day, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. For me, the added benefit, aside from getting in great shape, is having food available at all times, which is SUPER nice!

You really need to post this in r/cico and r/weightlossadvice. Better yet, the mods there should have this linked or stickied.

There's so much amazing hidden information like this out there! It's like discovering calisthenics..."hey, did you know that you could get super ripped & shredded at home using your own body for FREE, no equipment or gym pass required?" hahaha

I always spam out the link to the posts above because I WISH I had known about macros AGES ago!! It's the magic secret for dieting! And it's BRILLIANT! There is no food morality...no "bad" foods, no cheat meals, no cheat days! You pick the food & you pick the meal timing! It does, however, require that people put on a "gold digger" hat & dig for gold through the two initial rites of passage:

They have to be willing to accept the truth of how things operate in reality. Your body is a machine. It runs off fuel. Feel it the right fuel, get the results you want! No voodoo, no special supplements, no magic bullet. Adjust to your particular body & to your results over time to tweak it to get it where you want it. Hundreds of thousands of people are doing macros every day & don't have to "diet" anymore because they have a lifestyle where they have freedom in what they eat & when they eat! No more bro-science required!!

It seems hard, even though it isn't. There are plenty of free nutrition calculators for meals available online. The thought of having to do math is an instant deterrent for some people, or having to count their meals, etc. Personally I do meal-prep, that way I (1) don't have to cook every single meal in the heat of the moment, and (2) can just pack up my giant insulated lunchbox (I use an Isolator Fitness 6-pack bag) & do the macros the night before so I'm not getting annoyed doing numbers all day long lol.

If you're interested in macros & in making it easier for your self & in finding out what cool stuff is out there & available for you, spend some time reading through these links: (including a method for saving up for cool kitchen stuff!)

Longform reading on mindset & meal-prepping

What is a steam oven, and why is it awesome?

What is an electric pressure cooker, and why should I care?

I have some fun recipes here for both the combi oven & the electric pressure cooker:

https://www.reddit.com/r/kaidomac/comments/rqxxcc/table_of_contents/

I use a few different reheating systems (Anova Precision Oven, Roadpro 12V car oven, Hot Logic Mini heated lunchbox - 12V for car & 120V for office desk, and an inverter microwave). Here's some fun math to justify things:

The average American spends around $500k on food in their lifetime

The average family of 4 spends $10k a year on food ($7k is food at home and $3k is food away from home) & wastes $1.5k in food waste each year. So investing in things like an Anova Precision Oven, an Instant Pot, a suction vac-sealer, a chamber vac-sealer, a deep freezer, quality reheating tools, and a great lunchbox (my Isolator Fitness bag was like $129 but has a lifetime warranty!), especially with the TurtleSaver method linked above for saving up for stuff over time, is well-worth it because they pay for themselves in pretty short order!

If you only eat 3 basic meals per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) times 7 days a week, then that's 21 meals a week, 80+ meals per month, and 1,000+ meals per year to worry about

Plus, we're stuck in our bodies, which can either be a paradise from treating them right & feeling good as a result & looking good & being at a healthy body weight, or a prison! I grew up with chronic health issues (pain & fatigue) & didn't get to enjoy good health until recently, and part of that was from not feeding my body properly in order to maintain a healthy body weight & high energy 24/7!

I love macros + calisthenics because I know EXACTLY how to fuel my body correctly per my goals (weight management & high energy) & I can stay in great shape at home, no equipment to buy, no gym to join, etc. None of it is rocket science, but it takes an open-minded person who is willing to make a commitment to sticking to things like a daily workout routine & a meal-prep system to make it happen!

Ultimately, the bitter pill (but the one that is medicine, even though it tastes bad! lol) is that the bottom line is that no one is coming to rescue us & we shortchange ourselves. We do that through lack of education, lack of a plan, lack of education, lack of commitment, and lack of effort.

Mostly, I feel that it's because people are unintentionally ignorant about how their body works. It literally to me ballooning up to 250 pounds after a lifetime of being effortlessly skinny to dive into this stuff & find the truth of how my body operates, which in my case is that macros gives the best results & calisthenics makes daily exercise at home simple (not necessarily easy!! haha) & accessible!

We're all sitting on top of life-changing goldmines like this; the world is our oyster! The average grocery store carries more than 42,000 products. We have apps & smart devices to track our macros & our statistics (weight, workouts, etc.). We have more than 10 million recipes on Pinterest. We have amazing modern appliances that can automate the bulk of the effort of cooking for us. The only thing left to do is learn how it all works, get setup, and get COMMITTED to a personal plan to get where we want & stay there for life!

It's pretty awesome having the clarity of macros & the convenience of BWF available because then we can just build in eating, meal-prepping, and working out into our daily routine & get to enjoy far better health than not exercising & not having any food goals to pursue!

But, as George Carlin says, "ya gotta wanna!" Because if you don't wanna, ya ain't gonna! And ultimately it's a matter of personal education, setting up personal goals & support systems, and then making the commitment to putting in the simple daily effort to supporting your desired lifestyle! Here's another fun example of meal-prepping in action:

My current meal-prep approach is to cook one meal a day, mostly using my spiffy appliances to automate the work. So I sit down once a week & pick out 7 things to make for the week ahead. Then I go shopping for what I'm missing via a simple checklist of what I need to buy.

Each day after work, I meal-prep one meal or snack. Cook it up, divvy it into batches, and freeze it!

A typical batch makes say 6 servings. 6 servings times 30 days each month = 180 servings in my deep freezer every month forever, with hardly any effort! Saves a TON of money, saves time, saves frustration, gives me variety, helps me eat fewer ultra-processed foods, helps me look good (weight management), helps me feel good (high energy from properly fueling my body to feel energetic from getting gassed up properly each day!), etc.

In practice, at the risk of sounding like I'm gloating haha, but for the purposes of advertisement of "the approach" - I cook less than most people I know, I'm in better shape than most people I know, I save more money on food than most people I know, I'm healthier than most people I know, and I feel better than most people I know, not through magic workouts or magic foods or magic supplements or any other fad nonsense diets or anything like that, but simply because I have very simple support systems (calisthenics workout routine with iterative growth over time & a meal-prep system that enables me to eat delicious macros every day!) that are based on the truth of how our bodies work.

And the crazy part is that it's FREE! Nothing to buy! No subscriptions! No investment! No paid plans! Just try it out for a few months, be strict about it, adjust & tweak it to how your particular body responds, adjust for sugar sensitivity if needed (i.e. >20g carbs & then up the fats macros if you're diabetic), and enjoy great body-supporting food all day every day forever!

Again, the world is our oyster! We're all sitting on top of a goldmine; all it requires is setting up a couple simple systems for food & exercise. My week looks like this:

Planning: Pick out my workouts for the week

Planning: Pick out 7 things to cook for the coming week for meal-prepping purposes, one day at a time

Shopping: Buy what I need once a week for food

Daily: Eat food on desired schedule (I currently do 7 meals: breakfast/lunch/dinner, plus 3 snacks, plus dessert every day)

Daily: Do my workout (45 minutes weekdays for 15 minutes of calisthenics & 30 minutes of cardio, then cardio-only on weekends to give my muscles a break)

Daily: Pick out my meals for the next day from the freezer & put them in the fridge to thaw & add up my macros to hit my daily protein/carbs/fats requirements (per my current weight-management goal to lose/maintain/gain)

Cooking takes like 10 or 20 minutes of active hands-on effort per day, so I just treat it like an after-work chore. I do my workouts in the morning before eating & before the day gets started because I don't always have the energy or motivation to work out at the end of the day. Planning is a simple checklist-driven job for my next set of workouts & selecting what I want to cook & eat based off Pinterest & my recipe notebook.

So yeah, it's not bad!

My trick is:

Plan once per week; cook once per day

This results in hundreds of servings in my deep freezer every month!

This way, I have a huge pool of options to choose from & don't have to worry about food all day because I can pick out what I want before bed & tally it all up ahead of time!
